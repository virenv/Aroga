        - Aroga Living had its humble beginnings in the outskirts of Hyderabad in July,2018. The duo set out with an intention to provide the common man with chemical-free vegetables, at an affordable price. What started as a simple dream took form when an army veteran and his wife took a liking to their mission and gave them land to bring their vision into reality.
        - Initially, Aroga Living served a small group of customers. However, it grew over the years and is now serving over 350 loyal customers who depend on Aroga Living for high-quality and chemical-free vegetables.
        - While their high-quality produce is truly appreciated, what sets them apart is the farm visits they organize. These farm visits provide visitors with an experience with the rustic farm way of life. To date, Aroga has conducted 30 farm visits and these trips have become a much sought-after weekly affair now.
        - Aroga Living has now embarked on a new journey, by opening a store to move closer to their customers. This store not only houses everyone’s favourite farm produce but also includes chemical-free millets grown by the MP tribal community.
        - The family and community of Aroga Living are ever-growing and all-embracing. It is now in the capable hands of Shweta, Subha, and their friends who have vowed to scale the vision of Aroga Living to new heights.

      short: I had always missed the crunch in Fresh Greens when we bought it from store and the concerns about synthetic colorants, effluents being used to grow leafy veggies forced us to cut down the intake of greens in recent years...
      long: |
        ...ever since we moved to Aroga, I found the green leafy veggies to be tender & crisp and the assurance of organic farm to home, impeccable delivery and hassle free ordering and payments and above all the right work culture and responsive management of everything right from plantation to delivering it home, we’ve been enjoying the produce without questions regards quality in our minds... “Aroga” has propelled our thoughts only to “aarogyam” and your ever expanding portfolio of organic grains is enthusing us to try and make healthier choices!
         Keep it up and all the very Best!
