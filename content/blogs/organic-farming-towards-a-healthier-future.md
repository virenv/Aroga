# Organic Farming: Towards A Healthier Future

Organic farming in India has been steadily growing in popularity over the past few years and it’s easy to see why! They are safer than conventionally grown food, but they also taste great! Eating organic food doesn’t just give you peace of mind knowing that you can avoid pesticides and other chemicals — it’s also a great way to take care of your body and the environment simultaneously.

Food quality and safety have   become issues of high importance for the everyday consumer. Ever-growing environmental concerns and increasing food risks have severely undermined public faith in these products. People today need assurance that the food they’re eating isn’t contaminated or full of chemicals before they can even consider it for purchase.

### Impact Of Organic Farming In India

Consumers are looking for safer and better food that can be produced through locally grown systems. Organic farming and food products are believed to fit this demand because they’re harvested safely while preserving the environment.

### Environmental

Organic farming is a safer alternative for the environment because it prohibits synthetic pesticides — which can be detrimental to water, soil, and natural wildlife.

Organic farms maintain more biodiversity than conventional farms because they use a variety of different crop rotation practices. This leads to improved soil quality, which has a higher percentage of organic matter, biomass, and enzymes and also preserves water infiltration and nutrient intake.

### 

Socio-Economic

##### **Organic farming is lucrative, hence many farmers are getting interested in it. Organic farming requires more labor than conventional methods, which means it creates more jobs for people in the agricultural industry.**

Organic farming has been proven to create more jobs in rural regions, which could mean a lower suicide rate among farmers. Isn’t it the need for the hour?

**_Factors that raise the price of organic food include the high cost of getting certified and paying for enough human resources to work long hours out in the fields. However, despite these factors, people are still willing to pay because they’re becoming increasingly aware of their health and what they put into their bodies._**

### **Sustainability**

Sustainable agriculture is integrated with three fundamental goals: environmental health, social and economic equity, and economic profitability.

Organic farming has the power to provide long-term economic viability while ‌being more profitable because of its higher premium price. Organic farming aids social sustainability by enabling rural people to reap benefits from agriculture-related development and integrate their traditional agriculture knowledge and practices with modern technologies.

Organic farming produces more healthy and safe food than traditional means. Aroga Living is one such initiative that aims to provide food products that are chemical-free, immune boosting and nutritious!
