# Farmer Friends — The Earthworms

Earthworms are one of the most important creatures in the world. They help to aerate and improve the quality of soil, which helps plants to grow better. They also help to decompose organic matter, which enriches the soil. Earthworms are a vital part of the ecosystem and play an important role in keeping it healthy.

They also help to decompose organic matter, making it available for plants to use as nutrients. Earthworms are an important part of the food chain, providing food for many animals including birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.

**_Aroga Living Farms is a local farm that uses earthworms in their potting mix. The earthworms help to aerate the soil and improve drainage. The farm is also working on a composting project, which will use the earthworms to compost food waste._**

The farm is able to produce a good quantity of chemical-free vegetables with the use of traditional practices.

## The use of earthworms is a sustainable practice that can be replicated by our community as well.

You can also become a part of sustainable Bharat and think bigger.

A kitchen garden is a great way to get fresh, quality vegetables at home. By using a quality potting mix and taking care of your plants, you can grow delicious vegetables right in your backyard. With a little effort, you can enjoy fresh, healthy veggies all season long.

If you’re looking to get into growing your own veggies at home, there are a few things you’ll need to take care of first. Namely, you’ll need to make sure you’re using a quality potting mix, as this will determine the health of your plants. Additionally, try to choose a spot in your kitchen that gets a fair amount of sunlight throughout the day.
