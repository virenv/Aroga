## Effects Of Pesticides On The Human Body

With the rise of population and increase in consumption rates post-green revolution, the food industry had to step up production to meet the growing demand. To assure a continuous growth process and maximize yields- chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and hybrid seeds were introduced. As expected, production went up, and people depended more on these chemical products for better results.

Conventional farming uses synthetic chemicals to kill pests and fight weeds while providing plant nutrition. The improper use of chemicals has adverse effects not only on crops’ health but the effects of pesticides on the human body also have some irreversible damages.  
  
**What Are The Adverse Effects Of Pesticides On The Human Body?**

The hazardous effects of pesticides on human health are well known. From the disastrous midday meal tragedy in the Bihar school to the Endosulfan pesticide incident in Kerela, chemical use during cultivation can cause major disasters.

### **Pesticides & Nervous System**

The effects of pesticides such as organophosphates and organochlorines are potent enough to cause problems for the human nervous system. Whether acute or chronic — or whether from long-term or short-term exposure, these chemicals can affect one’s health and cause major nervous disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

### **Pesticides & Fetus**

Pregnant women, when exposed to pesticides, can have a critical effect on their fetus. The fetus may develop a weak immune system and may increase the risk of cancer.

Few pesticides ‌have endocrine-disrupting chemicals that may lead to gestational and growth defects. Being said that, it is important to keep a check on your diet, especially if you are expecting!

### **Pesticides & Cancer**

Cancer is no longer a ‘once in a blue moon thing and has been associated with many chemicals and so with pesticides. The studies show some pesticides are carcinogenic- such as organochlorine and sulfates, while others like lindane and chlordane, can cause tumors.

Though chemicals can increase crop yield, they cause irreparable harm to people and the environment alike.

###### **These non-chemical pesticides are harmless to the environment while still being an effective technique for controlling pests that destroy plants. Organic food gives you a healthier immune system because it contains higher levels of nutrients than regular food.**

#### And we won’t be wrong if we say that COVID-19 has drastically changed the lifestyle of, especially urban people. Are we?

The immune system of the body is the natural defense against any disease. It is now the time for us to consume organic products and start living a healthier lifestyle.
