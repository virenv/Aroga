# Is Organic Food Better For Humans?

The ever-present need for a healthy life persists in the human mind,  
and many humans are implementing changes so they can fulfil this desire. These changes include activities such as meditation and yoga, exercising,  
and consuming organic food, all of which contribute greatly towards  
attaining good health.  
  
**_Organic food is becoming increasingly popular among the other things mentioned. But, with popularity comes great doubts! So many people often find themselves wondering “if eating organic food improves life?” “Is organic food better for humans?”, “Are vegetables grown from chemical-free farming more nutritious?”, to which we answer- thousand times yes, organic food is better for humans._**

## **Why Is Organic Food Better For Humans Than Regular?**

It was the USDA, that first defined what organic means when they established standards for such practices. Farmers are not allowed to use any kind of chemical fertilizer, pesticide, or chemical preservatives to grow their produce. Hence, organic food is chemical-free in every aspect.

Organic food has been said to have greater nutritional value than non-organic food. This is because organic food is grown without chemicals which means that it produces more vitamins and antioxidants that protect it naturally from pests and weeds.

If you’re allergic to certain foods or sensitive to chemicals and preservatives, eating organic is a great way for you to feel better.

### **Health Benefits Of Organic Food**

Owing to several health benefits of organic food, the idea of incorporating it into our lives is not bad!

### Toxin-Free

Commercial or conventional farming involves the use of pesticides such as organophosphates to kill pests that attack fruits and other crops. You might think this pesticide would only hurt bugs and pests, but it is also dangerous for humans. And a Not-So-Fun-Fact, this pesticide was used in World War I as a toxic nerve agent! Scary right?

### No Artificial Flavor

A lack of artificial flavors and preservatives makes organic food friendlier to our gut. Less than 40 synthetic substances can be used in organic packaged foods, and only after they have been examined and reviewed by independent government experts or departments.

On the contrary thousands of artificial preservatives, flavors and colors are added during conventional farming which is linked to serious health issues.

### More Nutritional Value

What if I told you that there are nutrients like vitamins C and D, calcium, magnesium, iron, and phosphorus (just to name a few) — that are found at higher levels in organic produce? Your immune system would thank you for choosing not only more healthy food but also safe from heavy metals.

> **_There are hundreds of reasons to choose certified organic over conventional products. A few studies have reported that organic produce has higher levels of vitamin C, certain minerals, and antioxidants — thought to protect the body against ageing, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Choosing organic means you will reap the benefits without having to worry about harmful pesticides or contaminants present in both fresh vegetables and fruits._**
