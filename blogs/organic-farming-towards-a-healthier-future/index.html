Organic farming and food products are believed to fit this demand because they’re harvested safely while preserving the environment.</p><h3 id=environmental>Environmental</h3><p>Organic farming is a safer alternative for the environment because it prohibits synthetic pesticides — which can be detrimental to water, soil, and natural wildlife.</p><p>Organic farms maintain more biodiversity than conventional farms because they use a variety of different crop rotation practices. This leads to improved soil quality, which has a higher percentage of organic matter, biomass, and enzymes and also preserves water infiltration and nutrient intake.</p><h3 id=heading></h3><p>Socio-Economic</p><h5 id=organic-farming-is-lucrative-hence-many-farmers-are-getting-interested-in-it-organic-farming-requires-more-labor-than-conventional-methods-which-means-it-creates-more-jobs-for-people-in-the-agricultural-industry><strong>Organic farming is lucrative, hence many farmers are getting interested in it. Organic farming requires more labor than conventional methods, which means it creates more jobs for people in the agricultural industry.</strong></h5><p>Organic farming has been proven to create more jobs in rural regions, which could mean a lower suicide rate among farmers. Isn’t it the need for the hour?</p><p><strong><em>Factors that raise the price of organic food include the high cost of getting certified and paying for enough human resources to work long hours out in the fields. However, despite these factors, people are still willing to pay because they’re becoming increasingly aware of their health and what they put into their bodies.</em></strong></p><h3 id=sustainability><strong>Sustainability</strong></h3><p>Sustainable agriculture is integrated with three fundamental goals: environmental health, social and economic equity, and economic profitability.</p><p>Organic farming has the power to provide long-term economic viability while ‌being more profitable because of its higher premium price. Organic farming aids social sustainability by enabling rural people to reap benefits from agriculture-related development and integrate their traditional agriculture knowledge and practices with modern technologies.</p><p>Organic farming produces more healthy and safe food than traditional means. Aroga Living is one such initiative that aims to provide food products that are chemical-free, immune boosting and nutritious!</p><p><strong><em>At Aroga Living, we are committed to nurturing the land and offering organic farming solutions. For us, it’s all about sticking to our mission of a “healthier India”. Hence, we have converted our vast tracts of land into lush fields bursting with organic produce, and we ensure food safety from farm to plate.</em></strong></p></div></div><div class=mb-13p875><div class="d-none md-d-block"><div class="subscribe py-2p875 border-1p375 mb-4p75 md-border-3p5"><div class="subscribe__subtitle text-center fw-500 fs-1 lh-1p5 text-subtitle-color mb-0p562 md-fs-1p44 md-lh-1p5 md-mb-p5">Our Newsletter</div><div class="subscribe__heading text-center fw-700 fs-1p728 lh-2 mb-1p9375 md-fs-2p5 md-lh-3p5 md-mb-3">Sign Up to Our Newsletter</div><div class=d-flex><div class="col-12 col-md-6 md-mx-auto d-flex flex-column md-flex-row"><div class="subscribe__input-wrapper px-1 mb-1 flex-grow-1"><input type=email name=email placeholder="Your Email" class="subscribe__input fs-1 lh-1p5 px-1"></div><button type=button class="btn btn-action fs-1p125 lh-1p5 border-1 px-2p1875 d-block mx-auto">Sign Up</button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mountains-and-farms absolute" aria-hidden=true></div><script src=https://arogaliving.co.in/js/xs-menu-toggle.min.js type=application/javascript></script></div><footer class="d-flex flex-row flex-wrap"><div class="col-6 col-md-4 mb-2"><a href=https://arogaliving.co.in/ class="mb-1p25 d-block"><img src=https://arogaliving.co.in/images/aroga-logo.png alt=" Logo"></a><div class="copyright fs-p83 lh-1 text-subtitle-color mb-0p562">©2022 - All rights reserved</div><ul class="social p-0 m-0 d-flex flex-row"><li><a href=https://facebook.com class="fs-1p728 social__link mr-1"><i class=icon-facebook></i></a></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com class="fs-1p728 social__link mr-1"><i class=icon-linked-in></i></a></li><li><a href=https://instagram.com class="fs-1p728 social__link mr-1"><i class=icon-Instagram></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-md-4"><div class="menu__title fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500 mb-0p562">Categories</div><ul class="menu p-0 m-0"><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/featured class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Features</a></li><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/best-selling class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Best Selling</a></li><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/quality-scale class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Quality Scale</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-md-4"><div class="menu__title fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500 mb-0p562">Legal</div><ul class="menu p-0 m-0"><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/terms class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Terms of Service</a></li><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/privacy-policy class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/laboratory-test class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Laboratory Test</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-md-4"><div class="menu__title fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500 mb-0p562">Company</div><ul class="menu p-0 m-0"><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/about class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">About</a></li><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/team class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Team</a></li><li class=mb-0p562><a href=/contact class="text-subtitle-color fs-p83 lh-1 fw-500">Contact</a></li></ul></div></footer></div></body></html>
